# Neural VM Experiments

## Project Overview
Building a Neural Virtual Machine (NVM) with atomic components and a universal context bus for cross-architecture neural computation.

## Core Concept
Instead of lossy tensor handoffs between neural components, preserve full computational state (Q,K,V states, attention patterns, semantic intent, etc.) in a hyperbolic space-based context bus.

## Research Questions
1. What's the minimal set of neural "opcodes" needed?
2. How do we compile high-level operations into neural bytecode?
3. What semantic information is preserved vs. lost in translation?
4. Can we measure "semantic fidelity" across VM interpretations?

## Experimental Approach

### Phase 1: Atomic Component State Capture âœ…
- Build instrumented neural components that capture ALL internal state
- Analyze what information is actually important to preserve
- Extract requirements for hyperbolic space design

### Phase 2: Neural Context Bus Design (Next)
- Build hyperbolic space storage system with dimensional layers
- Implement universal read/write/transform interfaces
- Test lossless state preservation

### Phase 3: Cross-Architecture Translation (Future)
- Build neural bytecode compilation/interpretation
- Test semantic fidelity across different model types
- Measure preservation vs. loss in translation

## Files
- `atomic_components.py` - Instrumented neural components with full state capture
- `bus_analysis.py` - Experimental framework to analyze storage requirements
- `bus_requirements.json` - Generated specifications for neural context bus

## Vision
Enable transformer attention states to guide diffusion model generation, CNN feature hierarchies to inform graph neural networks, etc. - true cross-paradigm neural computation with semantic preservation.

## Research Impact
This positions the work as solving fundamental infrastructure problems in AI, enabling new types of hybrid architectures and cross-modal reasoning.
